    <string name="bio">Add a ScrollView with a TextView showing information about yourself to the layout.\n
        Style the TextView with NameStyle, and add additional styling to separate the scrollable text from the edges of the screen.\n
        Add some spacing between the lines using the lineSpacingMultiplier property to the TextView.\n
        The "Extract dimension resource" menu option is not available for this attribute, so you will have to add it to dimens.xml by hand.\n
        If you want to start at this step, you can download this exercise code from: Step.03-Exercise-Add-ScrollView.\n
        You will find plenty of //TODO comments to help you complete this exercise, and if you get stuck, go back and watch the video again.\n
        Once you’re done, you can check your solution against the solution we’ve provided here: Step.03-Solution-Add-ScrollView or, using this git diff.</string>
